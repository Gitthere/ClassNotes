UNIX PERMISSIONS

  ls -lah
   
    permissions  username   group   filelist  date created

      permissions:  -|rwx|-rw-|r--   | denotes directory (octet)

         rwx = user, rw- = group, r-- world


                                file                     dir
            r = read

            w = write

            x = execute   run                    list contents


CHANGING PERMISSIONS

   2 ways:

     octal:

     r -4, w - 2, x - 1:
       rwx = 7, rx = 5, r-- = 4, rw- = 6

     chown - to change ownership:  user   g.html(filename)
   
        chown - jon:staff (user:group)   filename


     shorthand:

       chmod g+r g.html

          [u, g, w] [+, -] [r ,w ,x]

            ug+rw: owner and group able to read write
            w-rwx: world not able to read, write, execute

           chmod 6 4 0 *:  6 4 0 for all three - user, group , world
           chmod w-r *

           chmod go-wx = r--|r-- (doesnt affect user)


        2 executable types:
           scripts
           binaries

          #!(shebang)
          #!/bin/bash (bourne again shell)

http: hyper text transfer protocol


  A.  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUT A URL IN BROWSER'S ADDRESS BAR?

    1.  Domain name translation: request for IP address.  

    2.  GET request to port 80 of webserver.browser sends http request (GET-web, POST-web, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS) to your DNS (Domanin Name Server - IP address).  When you register your domain name the DNS records will tell all the DNS servers in world about your url so will take 20min - 48hrs for all servers to find your url.
    name resolution to translates to an IP address

    Then GET request sends headers (http status code)

    3.  webserver responds with Headers (some sort of html - url, cookies, meta)

    webserver processes request and sends response with   Headers and body (html) back to browser

    4.  html renders in browser

        loops cycle (from step 1 -4) for every asset in the html in order to render in browser


    DNS sole purpose:
      translates domain name into IP address


    /etc/resolv.conf: checks for name server
    DHCP - assignes IP address
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4

    webserver purpose is to response to http request from browser

      servers: 2 types
        -physical box
        -server daemon service: 4321 http-server

      commonly used WEB servers:
        - Apache (most installed)
        - IIS (microsoft)
        - Nginx 
        - GWS (google web services)
        - AWS



    NS - Name Server
    NS1.DIGITALOCEAN.COM
    NS2.DIGITALOCEAN.COM

      -registrar - ie GoDaddy, set nameservers for domain name here
      -DNS records - you can list what domain names go to which server. records set at DNS host
        -3 types of DNS records
          - A record
            - sets hostname to IP address
          - MX record
          - C name record
      - web hosting
      -NS record points to DNS servers

      As an option:
        name - GoDaddy
        DNS - Dreamhost
        Hosting - Digital Ocean, linode.co rackspace.com


    B. IP address: 80 (port 80) then sent to web server.  web server has daemons (constantly running process) listening on port 80 which is the http port. (w3c - world wide web consortium dictates ports: 22 ssh, 21 ftp, 23 telnet, 443 https).  Headers (url, cookies, meta data), body is blank.  daemons respond with html, js, css jpg, png. mulitple requests as page is loading html.  

    <Don't google, goDaddy for domain names that you are interested in purchasing.>
    INSTEAD USE WHOIS XXX.COM FROM TERMINAL
      query on name itself, response is who owns and name servers


    curl -I: download and display whatever request you gave it, the -I is just the headers


    dig: ask DNS server to translate into IP address

    HTTP Verbs
      GET  -  most servers can only do this and POST
      POST -  method: PUT or method DELETE as most 
              servers can only do GET or POST
      PUT
      DELETE
      OPTIONS - returns types that server handles

    HTTP Response Codes
      500-599 SERVER ERROR
      400 CLIENT ERROR
      300 REDIRECTS
      200-299 SUCCESSFUL
      100 INFORMATIONAL

        200 SUCCESS
        301 PERMANENT REDIRECT (sever will cache fact 
            that not there)
        302 FOUND TEMPORARY REDIRECT (will not show 
            you know)
        404 NOT FOUND

      git checkout books.xml
        replace with latest version of books.xml

      git checkout d93432 books.xml
        will revert books.xml to that version back in time, no changes included so need to commit before doing

      git checkout master 
        checkout everything in master 

      git checkout d92343
        checkout allows to look at previous commit.  detached head state so can't commit

      git checkout -b fix_login
        makes new branch called fix_login and goes into it


      Concatenate:  adding strings together
        var a=200, var b="string", 
        ex. 200 + "22" = 20022 console.log (a+b)
            200 + "2c" = NaN  console.log (a-b)

DOM - DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
  API for interacting with html/xml docs that provides a structure of a document reperesented as a tree and defines the way the structure can be accessed to change structure, style, and content

    TREE STRUCTURE
    each node has one parent except the root parent (window).  nodes can have 0-n children.

    model: window, document, html, body, p#para1

    API is for other apps to have access to an app.
      (Application Programming Interface) A language and message format used by an application program to communicate with the operating system or some other control program such as a database management system (DBMS) or communications protocol. APIs are implemented by writing function calls in the program, which provide the linkage to the required subroutine for execution. Thus, an API implies that a driver or program module is available in the computer to perform the operation or that software must be linked into the existing program to perform the tasks.


    getElementById()
      function

    innerHTML
      property


    EVENTS - type of object that is short lived.  always listening.  could be on window, document.  write script that could trigger events


    ARRAY - list of items/elements, can hold other arrays. Properties: length. can assign to a variable.

TDD
  Test Driven Development - used for data modeling
    1. Write test
    2. Run test
    3. Implement functions/software
    4. Passing test
    5. Refactoring. Add comments on code and documentation

BDD
  Behavior Driven Development - tests for broken software as users will find ways that sw has not accomodated for. features and functionality. use of "should". this is what stakeholders want to see.  built from users perspective.

    Jasmine BDD 2.0


6:12:14

MOCHA AND CHAI DO WHAT JASMINE DOES, BUT WILL ALLOW FOR MORE CUSTOMIZATION. AND WILL ALLOW FOR MORE TDD OR BDD STYLES.
  USE 'spec' IN MOCHA TO GET MORE DETAIL ON "ASSERT", "EXPECT", "SHOULD" TESTS.

MOCHA - TEST RUNNER, DOESNT DO ANY ASSERTIONS
  need TEST folder for each dir: .js

CHAI - ASSERTION LIBRARY: SHOULD, ASSERT AND EXPECT

LIBRARY
  COLLECTION OF TOOLS. HAS A NAME, VERSION.  IT CAN ALTER THE WAY THAT YOU WRITE YOUR CODE.  YOU DONT WANT TO INCLUDE MULITIPLE CONFLICTING LIBRARIES - THIS IS RESPONSIBILITY OF DEV AS WILL NOT RECEIVE AN ERROR MSG.

    JQuery is a library.

        $ is a selector - shorthand for JQuery
          $("selector")

          $("#container")

CALLBACK FUNCTION

  1. PASSING IN ANY FUNCTION AS AN ARGUMENT TO ANOTHTER FUNCTION
  2. FUNCTION IS EXECUTED
  3. INVOKE CALLBACK USING ();


  "do after"

  function findDog (name, then) {
    //search for dog
      var found = getDogByName(name);
      if (found != undefined) {
      then(found);
      }
  }

  findDog("Kasper", function(dog) {
    //pet
    //groom
    //cook
  }


  DOCUMENT READY

    Description: Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded.

    While JavaScript provides the load event for executing code when a page is rendered, this event does not get triggered until all assets such as images have been completely received. In most cases, the script can be run as soon as the DOM hierarchy has been fully constructed. The handler passed to .ready() is guaranteed to be executed after the DOM is ready, so this is usually the best place to attach all other event handlers and run other jQuery code. When using scripts that rely on the value of CSS style properties, it's important to reference external stylesheets or embed style elements before referencing the scripts.

    In cases where code relies on loaded assets (for example, if the dimensions of an image are required), the code should be placed in a handler for the load event instead.

    The .ready() method is generally incompatible with the <body onload=""> attribute. If load must be used, either do not use .ready() or use jQuery's .load() method to attach load event handlers to the window or to more specific items, like images.

    All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent:

    $( document ).ready( handler )
    $().ready( handler ) (this is not recommended)
    $( handler )
    There is also $(document).on( "ready", handler ), deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. This behaves similarly to the ready method but if the ready event has already fired and you try to .on( "ready" ) the bound handler will not be executed. Ready handlers bound this way are executed after any bound by the other three methods above.

    The .ready() method can only be called on a jQuery object matching the current document, so the selector can be omitted.

    The .ready() method is typically used with an anonymous function:


    $( document ).ready(function() {
      // Handler for .ready() called.
    });
    Which is equivalent to calling:

    $(function() {
      // Handler for .ready() called.
    });
    If .ready() is called after the DOM has been initialized, the new handler passed in will be executed immediately.

PROJECT - WORKING THROUGH PROCESSES

  SMALLER PIECES
  TASKS - START WITH THE HARDEST ONES. 
    FER - FINAL END RESULT (HOW IS SHOULD LOOK OR BEHAVE?) 
      1. HOW DO I KNOW IF I'VE COMPLETED THIS TASK?

      2. HOW IS IT NOW?

        </form>

      </body>

          enctype - IS NECESSARY FOR UPLOADING IMAGES AND LONG PIECES OF DATA
          action - is url path to send data to
          input - name="" should be variable friendly; maxlength=10 (so users don't write a lot)
          method - GET OR POST

    4. JS
                                          (next is OPTIONAL)
  server.post('/output', function(req,res,next) {
  console.log(req.body.filename, req.body.content);
  fs.writeFile(req.body.filename, req.body.content, function (err) { //CREATES NEW FILENAME AND CONTENT AND    
                                                                     //FILE IN DIRECTORY THAT WORKING IN
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('It\'s saved!');
  });
  res.send(req.body.filename +' has been created.');//SENDS RESPONSE TO BROWSER WITH FILENAME AFTER FILE CREATED

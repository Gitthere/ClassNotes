UNIX PERMISSIONS

  ls -lah
   
    permissions  username   group   filelist  date created

      permissions:  -|rwx|-rw-|r--   | denotes directory (octet)

         rwx = user, rw- = group, r-- world


                                file                     dir
            r = read

            w = write

            x = execute   run                    list contents


CHANGING PERMISSIONS

   2 ways:

     octal:

     r -4, w - 2, x - 1:
       rwx = 7, rx = 5, r-- = 4, rw- = 6

     chown - to change ownership:  user   g.html(filename)
   
        chown - jon:staff (user:group)   filename


     shorthand:

       chmod g+r g.html

          [u, g, w] [+, -] [r ,w ,x]

            ug+rw: owner and group able to read write
            w-rwx: world not able to read, write, execute

           chmod 6 4 0 *:  6 4 0 for all three - user, group , world
           chmod w-r *


        2 executable types:
           scripts
           binaries

          #!(shebang)
          #!/bin/bash (bourne again shell)

http: hyper text transfer protocol


  A.  what happens when you put a url in a browser's address bar?

    1.  browser sends http request (GET-web, POST-web, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS) to your DNS (Domanin Name Server - IP address).  When you register your domain name the DNS records will tell all the DNS servers in world about your url so will take 20min - 48hrs for all servers to find your url.
    name resolution to translates to an IP address

    2.  Then GET request sends headers (http status code)

    3.  Headers
        url, cookies, meta

    4.  webserver processes request and sends response with   Headers and body (html) back to browser

    5.  html renders in browser

    6.  repeats cycle for every asset in the html in order to render in browser

    DNS sole purpose:
      translates domain name into IP address

    /etc/resolv.conf: checks for name server
    DHCP - assignes IP address
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4

    webserver purpose is to response to http request from browser

      servers: 2 types
        -physical box
        -server daemon service: 4321 http-server

      commonly used servers:
        - Apache (most installed)
        - IIS (microsoft)
        - Nginx 
        - GWS (google web services)
        - AWS



    NS - Name Server
    NS1.DIGITALOCEAN.COM
    NS2.DIGITALOCEAN.COM

      -registrar - ie GoDaddy, set nameservers for domain name here
      -DNS records - you can list what domain names go to which server. records set at DNS host
        -3 types of DNS records
          - A record
            - sets hostname to IP address
          - MX record
          - C name record
      - web hosting
      -NS record points to DNS servers

      As an option:
        name - GoDaddy
        DNS - Dreamhost
        Hosting - Digital Ocean, linode.co rackspace.com


    B. IP address: 80 (port 80) then sent to web server.  web server has daemons (constantly running process) listening on port 80 which is the http port. (w3c - world wide web consortium dictates ports: 22 ssh, 21 ftp, 23 telnet, 443 https).  Headers (url, cookies, meta data), body is blank.  daemons respond with html, js, css jpg, png. mulitple requests as page is loading html.  

    <Don't google, goDaddy for domain names that you are interested in purchasing.>
    INSTEAD USE WHOIS XXX.COM FROM TERMINAL
      query on name itself, response is who owns and name servers


    curl -I: download and display whatever request you gave it, the -I is just the headers


    dig: ask DNS server to translate into IP address

    HTTP Verbs
      GET
      POST
      PUT
      DELETE
      OPTIONS - returns types that server handles

    HTTP Response Codes
      500-599 SERVER ERROR
      400 CLIENT ERROR
      300 REDIRECTS
      200-299 SUCCESSFUL
      100 INFORMATIONAL

        200 SUCCESS
        301 PERMANENT REDIRECT
        302 FOUND TEMPORARY REDIRECT
        404 NOT FOUND
        403 FORBIDDEN
        500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

    "man whois" command in terminal: will give manual response to inquiry


    node myscript.js allows you to run js in terminal


    vim modes
    - insert, command


    git checkout
      - revert back to previous commit
      - branch, switch to different working branch
      - checking out files

      git checkout development
        checkout branch called development. puts current repository in development branch

      git checkout books.xml
        replace with latest version of books.xml

      git checkout d93432 books.xml
        will revert books.xml to that version back in time, no changes included so need to commit before doing

      git checkout master .
        checkout everything in master 

      git checkout d92343
        checkout allows to look at previous commit.  detached head state so can't commit

      git checkout -b fix_login
        makes new branch called fix_login and goes into it


      Concatenate:  adding strings together
        var a=200, var b="string", 
        ex. 200 + "22" = 20022 console.log (a+b)
            200 + "2c" = NaN  console.log (a-b)

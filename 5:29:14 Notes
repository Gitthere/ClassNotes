UNIX PERMISSIONS

  ls -lah
   
    permissions  username   group   filelist  date created

      permissions:  -|rwx|-rw-|r--   | denotes directory (octet)

         rwx = user, rw- = group, r-- world


                                file                     dir
            r = read

            w = write

            x = execute   run                    list contents


CHANGING PERMISSIONS

   2 ways:

     octal:

     r -4, w - 2, x - 1:
       rwx = 7, rx = 5, r-- = 4, rw- = 6

     chown - to change ownership:  user   g.html(filename)
   
        chown - jon:staff (user:group)   filename


     shorthand:

       chmod g+r g.html

          [u, g, w] [+, -] [r ,w ,x]

            ug+rw: owner and group able to read write
            w-rwx: world not able to read, write, execute

           chmod 6 4 0 *:  6 4 0 for all three - user, group , world
           chmod w-r *

           chmod go-wx = r--|r-- (doesnt affect user)


        2 executable types:
           scripts
           binaries

          #!(shebang)
          #!/bin/bash (bourne again shell)

http: hyper text transfer protocol


  A.  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUT A URL IN BROWSER'S ADDRESS BAR?

    1.  Domain name translation: request for IP address.  

    2.  GET request to port 80 of webserver.browser sends http request (GET-web, POST-web, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS) to your DNS (Domanin Name Server - IP address).  When you register your domain name the DNS records will tell all the DNS servers in world about your url so will take 20min - 48hrs for all servers to find your url.
    name resolution to translates to an IP address

    Then GET request sends headers (http status code)

    3.  webserver responds with Headers (some sort of html - url, cookies, meta)

    webserver processes request and sends response with   Headers and body (html) back to browser

    4.  html renders in browser

        loops cycle (from step 1 -4) for every asset in the html in order to render in browser


    DNS sole purpose:
      translates domain name into IP address


    /etc/resolv.conf: checks for name server
    DHCP - assignes IP address
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4

    webserver purpose is to response to http request from browser

      servers: 2 types
        -physical box
        -server daemon service: 4321 http-server

      commonly used WEB servers:
        - Apache (most installed)
        - IIS (microsoft)
        - Nginx 
        - GWS (google web services)
        - AWS



    NS - Name Server
    NS1.DIGITALOCEAN.COM
    NS2.DIGITALOCEAN.COM

      -registrar - ie GoDaddy, set nameservers for domain name here
      -DNS records - you can list what domain names go to which server. records set at DNS host
        -3 types of DNS records
          - A record
            - sets hostname to IP address
          - MX record
          - C name record
      - web hosting
      -NS record points to DNS servers

      As an option:
        name - GoDaddy
        DNS - Dreamhost
        Hosting - Digital Ocean, linode.co rackspace.com


    B. IP address: 80 (port 80) then sent to web server.  web server has daemons (constantly running process) listening on port 80 which is the http port. (w3c - world wide web consortium dictates ports: 22 ssh, 21 ftp, 23 telnet, 443 https).  Headers (url, cookies, meta data), body is blank.  daemons respond with html, js, css jpg, png. mulitple requests as page is loading html.  

    <Don't google, goDaddy for domain names that you are interested in purchasing.>
    INSTEAD USE WHOIS XXX.COM FROM TERMINAL
      query on name itself, response is who owns and name servers


    curl -I: download and display whatever request you gave it, the -I is just the headers


    dig: ask DNS server to translate into IP address

    HTTP Verbs
      GET  -  most servers can only do this and POST
      POST -  method: PUT or method DELETE as most 
              servers can only do GET or POST
      PUT
      DELETE
      OPTIONS - returns types that server handles

    HTTP Response Codes
      500-599 SERVER ERROR
      400 CLIENT ERROR
      300 REDIRECTS
      200-299 SUCCESSFUL
      100 INFORMATIONAL

        200 SUCCESS
        301 PERMANENT REDIRECT (sever will cache fact 
            that not there)
        302 FOUND TEMPORARY REDIRECT (will not show 
            you know)
        404 NOT FOUND
        403 FORBIDDEN
        500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

    "man whois" command in terminal: will give manual response to inquiry


    node myscript.js allows you to run js in terminal


    vim modes
    - insert, command


    git checkout
      - revert back to previous commit
      - branch, switch to different working branch
      - checking out files

      git checkout development
        checkout branch called development. puts current repository in development branch

      git checkout books.xml
        replace with latest version of books.xml

      git checkout d93432 books.xml
        will revert books.xml to that version back in time, no changes included so need to commit before doing

      git checkout master 
        checkout everything in master 

      git checkout d92343
        checkout allows to look at previous commit.  detached head state so can't commit

      git checkout -b fix_login
        makes new branch called fix_login and goes into it


      Concatenate:  adding strings together
        var a=200, var b="string", 
        ex. 200 + "22" = 20022 console.log (a+b)
            200 + "2c" = NaN  console.log (a-b)


JAVASCRIPT

  Everything is an object
    Functions are first-class objects
      Objects have properties and methods

  Global name space
    object is accessible from anywhere



  SELF: Self Invoking Anonymous Function

    (function() {

    })();

  PROMPT accepts up to 2 arguments

    prompt("msg", default answer);


DOM - DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
  API for interacting with html/xml docs that provides a structure of a document reperesented as a tree and defines the way the structure can be accessed to change structure, style, and content

    TREE STRUCTURE
    each node has one parent except the root parent (window).  nodes can have 0-n children.

    model: window, document, html, body, p#para1

    API is for other apps to have access to an app.
      (Application Programming Interface) A language and message format used by an application program to communicate with the operating system or some other control program such as a database management system (DBMS) or communications protocol. APIs are implemented by writing function calls in the program, which provide the linkage to the required subroutine for execution. Thus, an API implies that a driver or program module is available in the computer to perform the operation or that software must be linked into the existing program to perform the tasks.


    getElementById()
      function

    innerHTML
      property


    EVENTS - type of object that is short lived.  always listening.  could be on window, document.  write script that could trigger events


    ARRAY - list of items/elements, can hold other arrays. Properties: length. can assign to a variable.
      [10, 20, 40, 80]
      a[0]: first element is 0
      a.push will give number of elements in string

    HASH TABLE - 

          var ht = {
                  name:"Jon",
                  age:31
                  }

                  ht.name will return Jon
                  ht['name']will do same thing

    FOR LOOP
      for (var i = 0; i< 3; i++ )

TERMINAL
HOW TO CREATE NEW DIRECTORY IN AN EXISTING DIR AND THEN MAKE A FILE INSIDE OF THAT DIR

  pace@paces-MacBook-Air:~/Desktop/DevLeague|
â‡’  mkdir LongestWord/js && touch LongestWord/js/LongestWord.js

    1. state what dir you want new dir(js), to be created 
       inside of (LongestWord)
    2. && means to do this as well
    3. create file (LongestWord.js) and put it at end of path or  
       where it is going.

TDD
  Test Driven Development - used for data modeling
    1. Write test
    2. Run test
    3. Implement functions/software
    4. Passing test
    5. Refactoring. Add comments on code and documentation

BDD
  Behavior Driven Development - tests for broken software as users will find ways that sw has not accomodated for. features and functionality. use of "should". this is what stakeholders want to see.  built from users perspective.

    Jasmine BDD 2.0


6:12:14

MOCHA AND CHAI DO WHAT JASMINE DOES, BUT WILL ALLOW FOR MORE CUSTOMIZATION. AND WILL ALLOW FOR MORE TDD OR BDD STYLES.
  USE 'spec' IN MOCHA TO GET MORE DETAIL ON "ASSERT", "EXPECT", "SHOULD" TESTS.

MOCHA - TEST RUNNER, DOESNT DO ANY ASSERTIONS
  need TEST folder for each dir: .js

CHAI - ASSERTION LIBRARY: SHOULD, ASSERT AND EXPECT



6:14:14

LIBRARY
  COLLECTION OF TOOLS. HAS A NAME, VERSION.  IT CAN ALTER THE WAY THAT YOU WRITE YOUR CODE.  YOU DONT WANT TO INCLUDE MULITIPLE CONFLICTING LIBRARIES - THIS IS RESPONSIBILITY OF DEV AS WILL NOT RECEIVE AN ERROR MSG.

    JQuery is a library.

        $ is a selector - shorthand for JQuery
          $("selector")

          $("#container")
          $("container.specific") - all files with 'specific'
          $("p").attr("name"."jon")
                .fadeOut();


gee-mail-plus
  
  1. clone /Devleague/C2/gee-mail-plus
  2. git checkout -b farpot
  3. git checkout -b farpot.development
  4. git branch
  5. git push origin farpot.development
  6. git push origin farpot
  7. git checkout -b farpot.access.prepopulated data
  8. 

TO PUSH TO DEVELOPMENT BRANCH
  switch to main development branch
  git pull origin farpot.developmet
  gst
  git merge "mailbox" from the development branch
  gp

    ALWAYS PULL FROM DEVELOPMENT BRANCH FIRST, BEFORE PUSH.

Scrum - set of rules based on Agile, short meetings
  3 roles
    1. voice of stakeholder - Product Holder
    2. Developers
    3. Scrum Master - Project Mangager, servant leader, between 
       owners and develpers.  makes sure things are done correctly.  
      planning phase - sprints
      "what did you do yesterday?"  "What are you doing today?"
      "what are some issues that may arise?"

Agile - sw development able to make changes to large programs


EPIC - large story
  SPRINT - chapters
    USER STORY - little things

GIT
  
  MASTER BRANCH
    SHASTIN
      SHASTIN.DEVELOPMENT (ALL THE GOOD CODE TO BE DIST TO TEAM)
        SHASTIN.FIXOVERWRITINGINBOX
        SHASTIN.CLEANHTML (CREATE NEW SPACE TO WORK)

          BEFORE EVERYTHING, DO A GIT STATUS

          1. FROM FEATURE BRANCH (farpotshket.getNewMessage), CHECKOUT DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

              git checkout farpotshket.development


          2. FROM DEVELOPMENT BRANCH, PULL (from where and what branch) DEV [gpull origin farp.dev]

              git pull origin farpotshket.development


          3. FROM DEVELOPMENT BRANCH, MERGE FEATURE BRANCH

              git merge farpotshket.getNewMessage


          4. FROM DEVELOPMENT BRANCH, PUSH (from where and what branch)DEV BRANCH

              git push origin farpotshket.development


        ------------ BELOW IS OPTIONAL -------------------      

          5. FROM DEV CHECKOUT NEW FEATURE BRANCH (OPTIONAL)
          6. FROM ALMOST ANY BRANCH, GIT BRANCH -D OLD_FEATURE_BRANCH ( TO DELETE BRANCH)

          WIP - WORK IN PROGRESS IF PUSH CODE NOT WORKING

          m(odify) app.js - not clean so will not keep changes
            create new branch to backup

            git stash
            git stash pop - only applies modified changes and removes from list of stashes
            git stash apply - doesnt remove

  TO WORK ON NEWLY PUSHED BRANCH
   1. git pull on dev to get the new pushed branch
   2. git checkout shastin. (goes into new branch and tracks)

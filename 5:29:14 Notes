Unix Permissions

  ls -lah
   
    permissions  username   group   filelist  date created

      permissions:  -|rwx|-rw-|r--   | denotes directory (octet)

         rwx = user (owner), rw- = group, r-- world


                                file                     dir
            r = read

            w = write

            x = execute   run                    list contents


Changing Permissions

   2 ways:

     octal:

     r -4, w - 2, x - 1:
       rwx = 7, rx = 5, r-- = 4, rw- = 6

     chown - to change ownership:  user   g.html(filename)
   
        chown - jon:staff (user:group)   filename


     shorthand:

       chmod g+r g.html

          [u,g, w] [+,-] [r,w,x]

            ug+rw: owner and group able to read write
            w-rwx: world not able to read, write, execute

           chmod 6 4 0 *:  6 4 0 for all three - user, group , world
           chmod w-r *


        2 executable types:
           scripts
           binaries

          #!(shebang)
          #!/bin/bash (bourne again shell)

http: hyper text transfer protocol

  what happens when you put a url in a browser's address bar?

    1. browser sends http request (GET-web, POST-web, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS) to your DNS (Domanin Name Server - IP address).  When you register your domain name the DNS records will tell all the DNS servers in world about your url so will take 20min - 48hrs for all servers to find your url.

    /etc/resolv.conf: checks for name server
    DHCP - assignes IP address
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4


    NS - Name Server
    NS1.DIGITALOCEAN.COM
    NS2.DIGITALOCEAN.COM

      -registrar - ie GoDaddy
      -DNS records - you can list what domain names go to which server
      - web hosting

      As an option:
        name - GoDaddy
        DNS - Dreamhost
        Hosting - Digital Ocean, linode.co rackspace.com


    2. IP address: 80 (port 80) then sent to web server.  web server has daemons (constantly running process) listening on port 80 which is the http port. (w3c - world wide web consortium dictates ports: 22 ssh, 21 ftp, 23 telnet, 443 https).  Headers (url, cookies, meta data), body is blank.  daemons respond with html, js, css jpg, png. mulitple requests as page is loading html.  

    <Don't google, goDaddy for domain names that you are interested in purchasing.>
    INSTEAD USE WHOIS XXX.COM FROM TERMINAL
      query on name itself, response is who owns and name servers


    curl -I: download and display whatever request you gave it, the -I is just the headers


    dig: ask DNS server to translate into IP address


    HTTP Response Codes
      500-599 SERVER ERROR
      400 CLIENT ERROR
      300 REDIRECTS
      200-299 SUCCESSFUL

    man whois command in terminal: will give manual response to inquiry



    node myscript.js allows you to run js in terminal
